    <h1>All About Me</h1>  
    
     <h2> This is my story!</h2>
     <p>Hello! My name is Mika (Cheng-Ian) Shyu. I am from Taiwan and have been living in the UK for 11 years. I spent nearly all my time in the UK in Manchester for my work and study. This city is like my second hometown. I worked as a linguist for digital content creation and transcreation, and I am still working on the same position on a freelance basis.</p><p>This is the<a href="https://locaria.com/local-styles-film-title-translations-in-different-chinese-markets/" target="_blank">link</a>of an article I wrote about film title translation in different Chinese markets.(Taiwan, Hong Kong, China). I am looking for as many oppotunities as possible and feel excited to join more creative projects with the new skills I acquired. Please contact me through the email address provided below or visit my Linkedin page.</p>
