          <li>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.
              <p class="lightfont">Information technology (IT) plays a vital role in today's business. From large to small scale businesses, we could see the omnipresent use of IT tools in many aspects of business operation: internal communication, data management and relationship management with external suppliers and customers.<br><br> Businesses become more and more dependent on these tools with the development of technology and the recent trend of working from home. From the first thing in the morning starting with the online meeting, emails, to the data tracking and stock management, and live chat technology to offer a more instant customer service or online marketing, we cannot form a business without the application of information technology.<br><br> IT technology brings innovation to the modern world and is essential to businesses. With the good use of technology, business can save costs and enjoy efficiency and success.</p>
          </li> 
          <li>Describing methods, skills and resources
            needed to complete digital projects successfully –
            what do you need to make projects successful?
            What tools? What skills?
            <p class="lightfont">In order to complete digital projects successfully, first thing we need to understand what they are and what they consist of. Digital projects are, as it literally means, products that are developed and delivered on digital platforms. These are virtual products delivered as a service to the customers such as digital marketing campaigns, website design or software development. In general, like all other projects, digital projects begins with a plan, followed by the executing and testing process before the end product is produced. Plans help us knowing our purposes and expectations clearly. This is critically essential for the whole project to prevent us from going the wrong way. Once we have the plan we can go into execution to acquire the materials and apply the tools which are needed for the project.<br><br>What skills do we need through these stages to carry out digital projects? As a project manager, communication skills, technical skills and analytical skills are equally important for a successful project. Project managers need to have good communication, the ability to use technical tools for the project, and a critical mind to analyse the timeframe and material used on the project. What tools do we need? The most fundamental thing is a computer and the software required for the project. For the resources, if we're making a digital campaign for a brand then we would need their online content, social media videos and images as much as possible to create a successful campaign. </P>
          </li>
          <li>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.
            <p class="lightfont">To set up my own website, I would firstly do some researches on how to structure the site before I start to create the content and pages, and run the testing and quality check before I publish it.
            <a href="https://trello.com/b/8GKUHJ7H/my-website" target="_blank">Here is the link.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
            <p class="lightfont">There are many potential risks that may cause digital projects to fail. Factors which are beyond our control such as new released versions of phone system that doesn't  work well on the software we just developed or the company website we worked half way through have a new marketing strategy that is completely different from the direction we aimed. There could also be failures caused by being over-optimistic. Sometimes the timeframe and budget given didn't consider the potential problems that we may encounter. When the issues occurs, they cause delays to the projects and lead to failures.</p>
        </li>
          <li>Describe how you would go about selecting
            and using IT systems and software – how do you
            select the right kind of technology for the job?
            <p class="lightfont">When it comes to choosing the right tool for our jobs, we always need to understand what are needed for the job and what is the priority of our client. If the time and budget is more sensitive to our client, I may want to use the IT systems and software that keep the efficiency high in order to meet the deadline. Otherwise, if quality comes first, I would choose the software that meet clients' standard rather than sacrifice quality for velocity. Also I would keep my mind open when choosing the right IT systems and software for my job. Focusing on new or most commonly used technologies would keep me up-to-date with the current trend and give me chance to grow my skills.</p></li>
            <li>Describe and provide analysis on how your
              chosen technologies have helped you achieve
              your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan
              <p class="lightfont">Trello board helped me clear my mind by listing each phase and step that should be completed in the project. When working as a team, we clearly knew what tasks were to be done by checking the list. Who was responsible for which task and what stage each task was at could also be visibly observed on the cards. This app made everything so organised that highly increase the efficiency and the ease of communication for a team project. Also, the provided templates gave very useful suggestions on how to make plans for similar projects. </P>
              </li>
              <li>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
                impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                <p class="lightfont">GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation which is designed to protect the data of individuals. After the new legislation introducing on 25th May 2018, there were some changes which would affect digital marketers in obtaining consent from users and data access. The users now have more control of how their personal data are used, which means when we collect information through customer's online activity for marketing purposes in a digital project, we face higher standards to obtain consent and users have the complete right to withdraw their consent for data processing. Also, reaching out to target customers by communicating directly through emails or instant messaging are also impacted by the GDPR.</p>
              </li>
               </ol>
       <li>Unit 1 Outcome 2</li>
           <ol>
              <li>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code
                <p class="lightfont">At this beginning stage, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) doesn't seem as straightforward and convenient as other website building platforms like Wix to me. It took me more time and effort to create simple pages without ready templates. Because I am still developing my coding skills, there are much more for me to explore on VS Code. I have discovered a lot of features on VS Code that can be utilized and manipulated which allow me to be as creative as I would like on my website. VS Code is highly recommended by many users and is a useful tool in doing business. This is a software and skill I would love to learn more about to be able to make the best use of the tool and build up a site from scratch that best suits my needs.    </P></li>
              <li> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code <p class="lightfont">I reckon Visual Studio Code is an appropriate tool for making websites. It is very flexible, therefore is also suitable for beginner developers. I could choose the way I preferred and use some basic knowledge I had to build my website with just some simple texts, pictures and links. Also, this is free of charge so a good entry tool for beginners to practice.</P></li>
              <li>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? <p class="lightfont">I am happy with my final project with the knowledge and skills I acquired from the course. In my opinion, the layout and navigation is good. I like the background image and colour tones I have chosen. The colours and headline fonts were particularly picked to match the background forest theme with the ease of reading in mind. Also the woods background metaphorically suggested for an exploration.<br><br> But I am not perfectly satisfied with the content in terms of the display and structure.
                The webpage would look more neat and professional if I had had more time to get help or do more researches to optimise it. 
                </P>
               </li>
               <li>Describe further improvements you can make to your project<p class="lightfont">There were mainly 3 improvements I would like to make to my project if there is a solution: fix the HL1s and menu on top, erase the first number in the ordered list and start counting from the next level (e.g 1.1), and remove the space before and after the link text in a paragraph.<br><br> 

                When browsing the pages, especially the "Written Work" section, my preferred way is the HL1 and menu stay fixed while I scroll down, and the texts can slide in and out as you browse with the menu and HL on top, so you know which page you are on. Besides, for the ordered list, I would like to remove the number 1 on the list title with only "Unit 1 Outcome 1" displayed and start counting directly from 1.1. So it shows completely the same as it does in the original PDF documents. Furthermore, the linked texts have spaces before and after, this makes the items look unnaturally standout in the paragraphs. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose <p class="lightfont">The outcome matches the basic requirements of this project. It has 3 pages, pictures, and a few html elements can be observed. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the skills I have learned from this course and also the understanding of using technology. </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Unit 1, Outcome 3</li>
            <ol>
             <li>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?<p class="lightfont">IT tools are made to help your works, so the benefits are apparent to be more efficient and productive. However, it also takes time to learn. Before you get fully familiar with the tools and make them do their best jobs, the time you invest is the main drawback, or I would say it is the investment that you have to make. I could have been more efficient when making my website if I had been more familiar with the use of the tool. Teamwork may help as well as we can exchange opinions and discuss for solutions when we have difficulties.</P>
            </li>
             <li>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency<p class="lightfont">Don't get stuck by small issues that won't affect the whole result, keep going and we might find the solution or change directions when things don't work. Set a timeline for each stage to remind us of the progress and avoid serious delays in the project. Also, take breaks to refresh your mind and increase the efficiency.</p>
            </li>
             <li>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? <p class="lightfont">I spent a little bit too much time on trying to code differently for a specific style I desired. To prove my productivity, I wouldn't put so much effort on things that was  just to add extra effects on a layout which was already acceptable. The extra time spent was not entirely necessary especially for a beginner, and due to the unexpected time used I delayed the whole project. Teamwork might help, as in a team, I wouldn't be able to insist on my own opinion which would potentially delay the project or I would be able to get new thoughts or solutions which could help me move on.     </p>
            </li>
            <li>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions<p class="lightfont">When things didn't work or didn't appear in the way I expected in my code, I would apply different properties and try different values in CSS to test if they worked on my elements, or check my html file for any errors. For example, if my link broke, I would check if it was a wrong attachment or missing tags. Another example with the background image I selected, it was blurred and moved along with the texts which wasn't ideal for the layout; I fixed the problem by adding the background attachment feature in the body selector.</p>
            </li> 
            </ol>       
        </ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Unit 2, Outcome 1</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Describing the content and layout for each page<p class="lightfont">I have 3 pages on my website: home page, about me page and written work page. The home page has a menu on top indicating the number of pages on this site, and two headlines to introduce what this site is about. The about me page also has a navigation menu on top, HL1 and 2, and a paragraph of self introduction. Same layout with the other two pages, the written work page contains the ordered list section in order to clearly display the questions and answers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Plan and create your website (Don't need to answer)</li>
    <li>Selecting and using web site features and
      structure (Don't need to answer)</li>
    <li>Selecting and using styles to keep your site
    consistent(Don't need to answer)</li>
        <li>Describing copyright and other constraints
          affecting websites<p class="lightfont">All websites are protected by Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 when they are set up. All the original content on the website including music, graphics, pictures, texts and videos are all under the copyright protection and the creator has the full right for the use and distribution. When creating websites, we need to be careful with the materials from third parties to prevent infringement of intellectual property. Also when naming your website, we should avoid using a name that has already been registered by a third party. Apart from the copyright, we should be careful with the comments we or someone else posts on the website. A defamation claim can arise if inappropriate statement found. </P></li>
          <li>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them<p class="lightfont">People with disabilities have wide diversities in the problems they face. They might have difficulties with their hearing, sight, cognitive abilities, speech or physical activities. For people with auditory disabilities, video content with no captions or audio content without sound control to turn the volume up would not be ideal for them to use. Same situation with the video content without the audio alternatives or texts or images don't have a clear colour contrast with the background can be difficult for people who have visual disabilities to access. Content and page layout structured in a complex way which doesn't have a good navigation or easy to read sentences are barriers for cognitive disabled people. Any settings on the website with voice-only interactions is not being thoughtful enough for users with speech disabilities and websites without full keyboard support or with short time limit on tasks would make it hard to use for physical disabled people.<br><br> To take all users into account and create a disability-friendly website, we should avoid the points mentioned above by improving the visual designs and content, and ensure the assistive technologies that disabled people use, such as screen readers and voice recognition software for text input can adapt well on our websites.</p></li>
          <li>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites<p class="lightfont">File types on websites that work out the best are: JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF. JPEG or JPG is the most common choice for images, while PNG and SVG are not just suitable for images but also have more advanced functions and performance than JPEG. PNG files support texts and graphics and won't lose the image quality. SVG can be animated and create high resolution images and graphics. GIFs can't process pictures with too many shades like JPEGs but they can be animated and ideal for small icons and logos.</p></li>
